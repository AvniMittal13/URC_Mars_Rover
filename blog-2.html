								<h3>URC and IIT Mandi (Part 1)</h3>
								<h4> üë•Introduction </h4>

								<p>
									<b>Hola Readers!</b>
								</p>	
								<p>
									By now we all are well aware of what, why, and how ‚Äòs‚Äô of URC. The introduction might
									have raised a lot of curiosities and questions in your all-time wandering mind. So we
									are back again with our second blog post describing how IIT Mandi is playing its part
									for months.
								</p>

								<p>
									It took months of effort, dedication, time, curiosity, enthusiasm, and zest for the team
									to reach where it stands today. People with expertise in various fields joined hands
									together to realize this long vision of IIT Mandi. So we present you the second part of
									this blog where you can understand how different teams are playing their role in the
									realization of our project. Each team has its role different from others yet they aim to
									combine together for the making of this project. Each team is being guided by a team
									leader and has also been assigned some mentors(Alumni) who give their inputs from time
									to time.
								</p>

								<h4>üèóÔ∏èTeam Formation</h4>

								<p>
									As discussed earlier the URC competition is held every year and the registrations are to
									be submitted with the team details by around the end of October. Now since the project
									was initiated in October through constant initiatives by the IIT Mandi Robotronics Club
									volunteers, there was not a lot of time to make the team! What began as an annual
									project under the Robotronics club of our college, have now taken a colossal form of a
									long-term project with the encouragement and help of administration and have been
									shifted under Science and Technology Council (SNTC) , IIT Mandi.

								</p>	
								<p>
									Soon, people with expertise from different branches and clubs were contacted for making
									of the team who were enthusiastic and motivated enough to realize this long-term
									project. Once heads and sub-teams were finalised, other people with expertise,
									enthusiasm and learning spirit were selected for the formation of the founding URC Team
									of IIT Mandi.
								</p>

								<h4>üèâThe Team</h4>

								<p>
									The objective of this endeavour was to form a team not only for the current URC
									(University Rover Challenge) but one that would form a strong foundation for the Mars
									Rover as a long-term project of IIT Mandi. This required a team that not only consisted
									of people with expertise in their respective domains but also newbies who had the
									interest and aptitude to learn and would be willing to carry this project forward.
								</p>

								<p>
									While forming the main URC Team the URC
									[guidelines](https://urc.marssociety.org/home/requirements-guidelines) provided a really
									good base for us to choose our members and decide what skills would be necessary for
									them to have or to learn and develop.

								</p>

								<h4>ü™õMechanical Team</h4>

								<p>
									The mechanical team is responsible for the mechanical aspects of the rover. This
									includes the design of the main body of the rover, suspension system, the robotic arm,
									wheels and the different attachment modules that are needed to perform the assigned
									rover tasks.
									Familiarity with CAD software and a good hold over vehicle mechanics is a must for this
									team.
								</p>

								<h4>üñ•Ô∏èSoftware Team</h4>

								<p>
									The software team is responsible for designing the internal algorithms(SLAM) of the
									rover. Every aspect of the rover‚Äôs design simulation, teleoperation of the rover and the
									robotic arm, Graphical user interface for rover control, and inter-component
									communication is being led by the software team.
								</p>

								 <h4>üí°Electronics Team</h4>

								<p>
									The electronics team is responsible for the building and setup of the electrical
									components. The tasks of this team include managing electrical circuits, managing the
									power distribution system, working on the communication module and designing the motor
									control system.
								</p>

								<h4> üå∑Lifescience Team</h4>

								<p>
									The URC competition has a separate module that requires the detection of life on the red
									planet using tests and equipment present on the rover. The life science team is
									responsible for deciding and building the modules for the rover that would permit the
									rover to perform onboard tests to detect the presence of life in the surroundings.

								</p>	
								<p>
									 <h4>üìäManagement Team</h4>
	
									With a project involving more than thirty people divided into four main technical teams,
									it was our utmost necessity to assemble a few folks who would be required to handle the
									surge, excitement, thrill, and sail the team through rough and tough times of the
									project. Not just this, they also are responsible for handling the budget, organizing
									long-but-interesting meetings, planning timelines, documentation, making numerous calls
									to faculties, students, volunteers, and laboratory assistants to make sure that the team
									is functioning to its full potential.
								</p>

								<h4>Team Structure</h4>

								<p>
									Now we knew what all teams would be needed and what would be their general
									responsibilities so the time comes to chose the people who will lead the charge! Each
									team has their own leads with full responsibility and control over how its team
									functions and the whole Team Deimos is led by a single project lead.
								</p>

								<p>
									In the next part of this blog, we would be elaborating on the workings, structure,
									members and personalities of each team in detail. For now, you can refer to the below
									graphical representation of the team structure.
								</p>

								<h4>üñäÔ∏èEnding Note</h4>
								
								<p>
									This post will have to end hereüòÅ from the next part we will be sharing some reading material together with the blogs,
									the material would be related to the team we cover and is intended to help anyone who is interested and wants to explore
									this amazing project. So stay tuned!
